cd laravelpt
cp .env.example .env
composer install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
npm install && npm run dev
php artisan storage:link
php artisan:serve
```

## Using Docker

It's also possible to use üê≥ Docker to setup & install the project please kindly follow the instructions:
At this point we assume you have docker & running on your machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laravel-portugal/website.git laravelpt
cd laravelpt
cp .env.example .env
cp docker-compose.override.local.yml docker-compose.override.yml
docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm website composer install --no-interaction
docker-compose run --rm website php artisan key:generate
docker-compose run --rm website npm install
